# Pokemon_Generator

This project demonstrates my expertise in leveraging JavaScript's asynchronous features to build an engaging web application by integrating with an external API. Utilizing advanced async/await techniques, I efficiently fetch Pokémon data from the Pokémon API. The main functionality is a button that, when clicked, randomly selects a Pokémon from the extensive list, presenting its details and image. This implementation highlights my ability to manage asynchronous operations and API interactions effectively, creating a dynamic and user-friendly experience. The project is an excellent example of modern JavaScript skills and demonstrates my proficiency in developing interactive web applications.
